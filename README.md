Sommeliers are able to tell the quality of wine by taste, smell, sight and mouth feel. What if you aren't a Sommelier and you want to make wine? How do you decide what is a good wine?

I have been tasked with predicting the quality of wine based off of 11 different features. These are chemical properties of wine, that can be quantified by anybody.

The qualities are as follows:

For more information, read [Cortez et al., 2009].
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
1. volatile acidity :   Volatile acidity is the gaseous acids present in wine.
2. fixed acidity :   Primary fixed acids found in wine are tartaric, succinic, citric, and malic
3. residual sugar :   Amount of sugar left after fermentation.
4. citric acid :    It is weak organic acid, found in citrus fruits naturally.
5. chlorides :   Amount of salt present in wine.
6. free sulfur dioxide :   So2 is used for prevention of wine by oxidation and microbial spoilage.
7. total sulfur dioxide 
8. pH :   In wine pH is used for checking acidity
9. density 
10. sulphates :    Added sulfites preserve freshness and protect wine from oxidation, and bacteria.
11. alcohol :   Percent of alcohol present in wine.
Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality (score between 3 and 8)


This is a regression Pproblem, that will be analyzed by different regression models to help determine the best evaluation of the predictions.
